## Description:
Created an application where people can look for tutors based on whatever school subject they need help with. Also implemented a help forum where people can post about things they need help on.

## List of Features / User Stories
For the project I planned to be able to:
* Full CRUD functionality
* User login/sign in/log out
* Being able to verify users for edit/delete
* Being able to search for specific subjects

I was not able to get to a search bar feature but it is definitly something I want to try when I have more time.
 

## List of Technologies Used
The technologies I used to create this are Python, Django, and Django templates.

## Issues throughout the process:
The big thing for me was that even though I did have a wireframe and a general idea of how it was going to look, I wasn't sure about the number of models I would need. I think having a better idea of everything before would have been good. Also had some slight issues on posting an image. I could make it on the admin side but not on the user forms. This was because I was missing a request.files.
